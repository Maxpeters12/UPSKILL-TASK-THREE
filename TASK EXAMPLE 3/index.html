                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Petermary Emmanuel, and welcome to my tech journey page.
                    My interest in technology began in 2021/2022 when I first traveled to see my Auntie in Anambra and was marveled by what I saw. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I met some kids designing a landing page website with some codes they fondly tagged "Unique codes". However, I didn't almost immediately believe that those codes are unique until I started seeing results when I began to stay closer to them as they design and do their task everyday. I wasn't just excited about what I saw but at the same time inspired. That feeling made me begin to develop interest in tech even before I gained admission in UNN to study Computer Science and Statistics.
                </p>
                <p>Since that time until now, my goal has been to become a full-stack developer, specialize in AI, contribute to open source projects and create impact in human. I am excited to continue learning and growing in this ever-evolving field.</p>
